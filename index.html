        <h1>Latest Weather at Mars
        </h1>
    <p class="introduction">Daily and previous 5 day weather measurements. Overall Mars is cold and
        has a much thinner atmosphere than Earth. Because it has about a sixth 
        of the pressure of Earth's atmosphere, the planet doesn't retain heat very long, 
        causing temperatures to drop quickly, as seen on the <b>high</b> and <b>low</b> measurements
